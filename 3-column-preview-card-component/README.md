## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

The child of a flex container won't be centered even with `align-items` and `justify-content` being set to `center` if there is not enough width for the child to fit.

### Continued development

Continue learning about different quirks of CSS.
