## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I became more familiar with the Tailwind classes.

### Continued development

I think I didn't get the colours of the project 100% right. That's an area I can improve on.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - Tailwind docs was heavily used as a reference to look up the different class names for styling.
- [SVGR](https://react-svgr.com/playground/) - This was used to convert SVG images to React components.
