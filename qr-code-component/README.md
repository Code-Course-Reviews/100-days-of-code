## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Mustard CSS](https://kylelogue.github.io/mustard-ui/index.html) - CSS Framework

### What I learned

I learnt to use rems instead of pixels as unit of measurement. Setting the base rem size in the `html` selector. Also got a little bit familiar with Mustard CSS.

```css
html {
  font-size: 15px;
}
```

### Continued development

Maybe something to work on is finding a more complex project that I can further explore what Mustard CSS has to offfer.
