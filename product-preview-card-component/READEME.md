## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about the text-decoration property value: line-through;

```css
#original-price {
  text-decoration: line-through;
  font-family: Montserrat;
  font-size: 12px;
  display: inline-block;
  margin-left: 15px;
  color: hsl(228, 12%, 48%);
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue working on the css layout. I felt this was the most challenging aspect of the project.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Referenced documentation for the picture HTML element and line-through property value.
